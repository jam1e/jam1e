# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jamie Ward.

I'm a freelance web developer based in Lincolnshire, UK. I create bespoke websites & WordPress themes for local businesses, events and organisations, focusing on responsive and easy-to-use designs.

## Projects

I've recently relaunched my project [Mablethorpe Online](https://www.mablethorpe.online) - an online tourist information centre for Mablethorpe, and the surrounding towns and villages.

I have been involved with [TheFactSite](https://www.thefactsite.com) since almost day one, and over the past 5 years have been their web developer, focusing on a complete rebuild of their theme, and additional custom plugins. Over the years I have written occasional posts on a range of topics from museums, to  cults of the world.


From 2018 to early 2023 I was working alongside the team at [Natterjack Creative](https://www.natterjackcreative.co.uk), where I managed their collection of websites for their clients, and worked on a whole range of new projects.


## Interests

When not working, I spend my time learning about the religions of the world and getting involved in local volunteer-lead programms & events. From time to time I've been known to do a little juggling, and can often be found at juggling conventions doing everything but juggling!
