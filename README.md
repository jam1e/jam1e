# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jamie Ward.

I'm a freelance web developer based in Lincolnshire, UK. I create bespoke websites & WordPress themes for local businesses, events and organisations, focusing on responsive and easy-to-use designs.

## Who I'm Currently Working With

Since 2018 I have been working alongside the team at [Natterjack Creative](https://www.natterjackcreative.co.uk), where I manage their collection of websites for local businesses, and help out on various new projects that come their way.

I have also been involved with [TheFactSite](https://www.thefactsite.com) since almost day one, and over the past 5 years have been their web developer, focusing on a complete rebuild of their theme, and additional custom plugins. Over the years I have written occasional posts on a range of topics from museums, to  cults of the world.

## Projects & Interests
I've recently relaunched my project [Mablethorpe Online](https://www.mablethorpe.online) - an online tourist information centre for Mablethorpe, and the surrounding towns and villages.

When not working, I spend my time learning about the religions of the world and getting involved in local volunteer-lead programms & events.
